## Release 0.6.0a3 (development release)

### New features since the last release

### Bug fixes

### Improvements

* A large number of linting corrections were made to improve the overall pylint report. These were mostly minor but essential modifications including restructuring, re-coding, optimization, updating `.pylintrc`, adding `.coveragerc`. The code quality score is improved to `A` for the released version. Check ["Files changed"](https://github.com/XanaduAI/flamingpy/pull/11/files) for details. [(#11)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/flamingpy/pull/11)

* `TODO` comments have been removed exclusively from files with low code quality grades. The Dev team has created tickets to be actioned for all removed TODO comments on separate (private) FlamingPy boards. [(#11)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/flamingpy/pull/11)

* `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `code_of_conduct.md`, and `CHANGLELOG.md` were imported and modified from the Strawberry Fields project. Dev team plans to extend these with customized details in future PRs. [(#11)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/flamingpy/pull/11)

### Documentation changes

* The new Xanadu Sphinx theme has been applied. Currently, most Xanadu OSS projects include their own version of the Xanadu Sphinx theme; however, the Xanadu Sphinx Theme repository is now publicly available and is the preferred way to access the Xanadu CSS theme and Sphinx directives. [(#17)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/flamingpy/pull/17) 
  * Deleted the doc/xanadu_theme directory
  * Updated doc/requirements.txt and doc/conf.py to reference and use the (centralized) Xanadu Sphinx Theme.
  * Replaced the Quantum Error Correction, Install, and FAQ static HTML files with reST ones.

* Relative paths cannot be used in README.md logos and were replaced with Github-hosted links. [(#5)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/flamingpy/pull/5)

* C++ imports are now placed within `try` blocks to avoid interrupting non-compiled installations, such as the ones currently used by readthedocs. [(#5)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/flamingpy/pull/5)

* Code coverage (quality) score was improved to a more acceptable `B-` level. [(#5)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/flamingpy/pull/5)

## Release 0.4.6a1

### New features since the last private release

* The first Cython function for Monte Carlo sampling, mostly to provide cythonization samples and testbeds, has been added. See [`cpp_mc_loop.pyx`](flamingpy/cpp/cpp_mc_loop.pyx) and [`simulations.py`](flamingpy/benchmarks/simulations.py) for detailes. 

### Improvements

* More options for Installation from Source: 
`setup.py` was updated to provide a no-compilation option for only installing (purely) Python libraries and separate options to compile `cmake` and `cython`-based codes. See the new [README.md](https://github.com/XanaduAI/ft-stack/blob/mc-cpp/README.md) for details.

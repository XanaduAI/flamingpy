    continuous-variable noise.

    Associates the nodes of an EGraph with continuous-variable quantum states,
    and its edges with continuous-variable CZ gates.

    For now, only a hybrid state of p-squeezed and GKP states is considered.

    Args:
        code (SurfaceCode or EGraph): the code object (so that code.graph is
            an EGraph) or an EGraph directly.
        state (dict, optional): the dictionary of all non-GKP states and their
            indices, of the form {'state': []}. By default, all states are
            GKP states.
        p_swap (float, optional): if supplied, the probability of a node being
            a p-squeezed state. Overrides the indices given in state.
        rng (numpy.random.Generator, optional): a random number generator
            following the NumPy API. It can be seeded for reproducibility.
            By default, numpy.random.default_rng is used without a fixed seed.

    Attributes:
        egraph (EGraph): the unerlying graph representation.
        _N (int): the number of qubits in the lattice.
        _adj (sp.sparse.csr_matrix): the adjacency matrix of egraph.
        _states (dict): states along with their indices.
        _delta (float): the delta from the Args above (after noise applied)
        _adj (array): adjancency matrix of the underlying graph.
        to_points (dict): pointer to self.egraph.to_points, the dictionary from

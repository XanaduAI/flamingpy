"""
A complete round of error correction
====================================

"""


######################################################################
# In this tutorial we will go over the minimal steps required to run
# through one round of quantum error correction: encoding, decoding, and
# recovery. This will allow us to demonstrate most of the functionality of
# ``FlamingPy``.
#


######################################################################
# The first step is to declare your choice of error-correcting code.
# Currently, FlamingPy gives you the option to use the *surface code*
# (also known as the *planar* or *toric* code, depending on its boundary
# conditions). In the measurement-based picture, the surface code is
# represented as a special graph state (see the :ref:`graph states tutorial <graph-states-tutorial>`)
# called the RHG lattice. We begin by specifying some code parameters:
#

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from flamingpy.codes import alternating_polarity, SurfaceCode
from flamingpy.cv.ops import CVLayer
from flamingpy.decoders import decoder as dec
from flamingpy.noise import IidNoise
from flamingpy.utils import viz

# QEC code parameters
distance = 3
# Boundaries ("open" or "periodic")
boundaries = "open"
# Error complex ("primal" or "dual")
ec = "primal"


######################################################################
# We will be discussing the properties of the code in more depth in
# another tutorial, but let us summarize them for you:
#
# -  The distance of the code will correspond to size of the
#    RHG lattice. More fundamentally, it represents the length of the
#    smallest logical operator: a logical :math:`Z` gate on the surface
#    code, for example, will require a string of :math:`d` physical
#    :math:`Z` gate on the qubits.
#
# -  The ``boundaries`` option will determine the connectivity of the
#    lattice at the boundary. In order to encode a single logical qubit,
#    the boundaries must be set to ''open''; this is also the choice that is
#    more easily realizable in hardware.
#
# -  The error complex refers to the kind of error we would like to
#    correct (analogous to correcting :math:`X` or :math:`Z` errors using
#    the gate-based surface code). A full round of error correction
#    involves correcting both primal and dual errors.
#
# Having defined these parameters, we can now instantiate the code and
# draw it with a simple command:
#

# Code and code lattice (cluster state)
RHG_code = SurfaceCode(distance=distance, ec=ec, boundaries=boundaries)
RHG_code.draw()


######################################################################
# By default, the primal nodes are drawn black and dual nodes as grey.
#


######################################################################
# Next, we have to add some noise to our ideal qubits. For this tutorial,
# we opt for a simple Pauli noise model, where each qubit has some
# independent probability of a phase (Pauli :math:`Z`) error:
#

p_Z = 0.3
IidNoise(RHG_code, p_Z).apply_noise()


######################################################################
# At this point, we seek help from the decoder to correct our noisy
# lattice. The two decoders currently available in FlamingPy are
# *minimum-weight perfect matching* (''MWPM'') and *Union-Find* (''UF'').
# Although MWPM is slower, it is standard and well-performing; let us
# select it:
#

decoder = {"outer": "MWPM"}


######################################################################
# The option ''outer'' here indicates that this is a qubit-level decoder
# taking in bit values. One may also specify an ''inner'' decoder if the
# qubits are, for example, GKP states, which are capable of performing an
# additional round of error correction themselves. We will go over this in
# more detail in another tutorial.
#


######################################################################
# Finally, we can run the ''correct'' function, which decodes and recovers
# the information. We can illustrate the full decoding procedure, for
# which we first specify some drawing options:
#

dw = {
    "show_nodes": False,
    "color_nodes": 'k',
    "show_recovery": True,
    "label_stabilizers": True,
    "label_boundary": True,
    "label_edges": False,
    "label": None,
    "legend": True,
    "show_title": True,
    "show_axes": True,
}

c = dec.correct(
    code=RHG_code,
    decoder=decoder,
    draw=True,
    drawing_opts=dw,
)
print(f"Success: {c}")


######################################################################
# Here's what we have drawn:
#
# -  The *stabilizer graph*, a representation of the codes with
#    information about the errors that have occurred.
# -  The *matching graph*, the processed stabilizer graph that is fed into
#    the decoder.
# -  The *syndrome and recovery* plot, where we visualize where errors
#    have ocurred (the red voxels) and the *matching* (lines connecting
#    the voxels) that shows where the bit values must be flipped to
#    recover the information.
#
# You can go back and forth between these plots by comparing the indices
# of the decoding graphs and those on the voxel plot. You may also display
# the RHG lattice by setting ''show_nodes'' to True.
#
# More information about all these steps will come in future tutorials;
# for now, you may visit our :ref:`introduction to error correction <quantum-error-correction>`

Introduction
============

Simulate all the error-correction steps--encoding, decoding, recovery, success check--for measurement-based quantum-error-correcting codes. Among these are CV-DV codes, whose inner encoding can be GKP states uniquely, or hybrid variations consisting of both Gaussian states and GKP states. The package is conveniently modularized, allowing the user to easily swap encodings, decoders, and other features, and provides a host of visual tools for ease of verifying correctness.

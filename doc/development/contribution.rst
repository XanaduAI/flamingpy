We welcome new contributions -- simply fork the FlamingPy repository and make 
a pull request (PR) containing your contribution. All contributors to FlamingPy 
will be listed as authors on the releases. Users who contribute significantly 
to the code (new plugins, functionalities, etc.) may get considered to be 
listed on the arXiv preprints for the FlamingPy. See our release notes and 
changelog for more details.

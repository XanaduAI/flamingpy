  FT-Stack is a hybrid Python/C++ library for efficient threshold estimations of combined DV-CV quantum codes and simulations of fault-tolerant quantum computers.
</p>

## Features
* Simulates error correction on combinations of CV and DV codes to obtain estimations of fault-tolerant thresholds. 
* Supports encoding qubits into GKP states (more precisely, combinations of GKP and squeezed states). 
* Is conveniently modularized, allowing the user to insert custom noise models, codes, decoders, backends and other features. 
* Provides a host of visualization tools for ease of verifying correctness.

## Download and installation 

FT-Stack requires **Python 3.8 or higher**. The recommended method to download and install FT-Stack, as well as all dependencies and precompiled C++ binaries, is through `pip` and our [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/ft-stack). In your choice of CLI (with a Python environment activated) run the following single line:

```bash
pip install ft-stack
``` 

### Installation from Source (advanced users)

If you are a developer and wish to manipulate and test FT-Stack source code, you can install from Source and appropriately configure C++ compilers and Python environments.

#### Short option

Having cloned `ft-stack`, installed **conda**, opened Anaconda Prompt, and activated a new environment, you may simply navigate to your local `ft-stack` directory and run the lines:

```bash
pip install -e .
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
``` 

These steps should work as long as there is already a C++ compiler installed on your machine. Otherwise, we recommend the steps in the following section.

#### Thorough (recommended) option

First, clone `ft-stack` through the Code tab above. A clean installation and configuration of compilers and Python environments can be achieved through CLIs. We recommend users employ **BASH** here (Windows users can rely on [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/wsl/install)). 

Next, install C/C++ compilers. Debian users can run `sudo apt update`, `sudo apt upgrade`, and `sudo apt-get install build-essential`, while Windows users should rely on Visual Studio C/C++ or similar. 

Now, set up your interpreters and customized virtual environments. We recommend using the light version of **Conda**, i.e. miniconda, or **virtualenv** for configuring Python environments. In particular, miniconda can be installed in BASH following this [guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html). Run the following to set up and switch to a new virtual env called, e.g., `ftstack`:
```bash
conda init
conda create -n ftstack python=3.9
conda activate ftstack
```
Lastly, change to the directory where FT-Stack was cloned and run:
```bash
pip install -e .
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
``` 
The first command installs and compiles the dependencies of FT-Stack while the second installs extra dependencies for testing purposes.

 FT-Stack is a Python library with several backends for efficient simulations of error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computers.
</p>

## Features
* Simulates error correction on combinations of CV and DV codes to obtain estimations of fault-tolerant thresholds. 
* Supports encoding qubits into GKP states (more precisely, combinations of GKP and squeezed states). 
* Is conveniently modularized, allowing the user to insert custom noise models, codes, decoders, backends and other features. 
* Provides a host of visualization tools for ease of verifying correctness.

## Download and installation 

FT-Stack requires **Python 3.8 or higher**. The recommended method to download and install FT-Stack, as well as all dependencies and precompiled C++ binaries, is through `pip` and our [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/ft-stack). In your choice of CLI (with a Python environment activated) run the following single line:

```bash
pip install ft-stack
``` 

### Installation from Source (advanced users)

If you are a developer and wish to manipulate and test FT-Stack source code, you can install it from Source. First, clone `ft-stack` through the Code tab above. Then, create and activate a new virtual environment. If you use **Conda**, for example, you may run the following:

```bash
conda create -n ftstack python=3.9
conda activate ftstack
```

Finally, change to the directory where FT-Stack was cloned and run:

```bash
pip install -e .
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
``` 

The first command installs and compiles the dependencies of FT-Stack while the second install extra dependencies for testing purposes. 
If you encountered a CMake error, you may need to (re-)install it through `conda install cmake` before re-attempting the above. For more detailed instructions and recommendations, including how to configure your environments, compilers and resolve errors, see our Frequently Encountered Errors in the documentation [coming soon].
